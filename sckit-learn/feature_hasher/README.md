# README: Feature Hashing and Lesser-Known Scikit-Learn Features

## Overview
When working on data science modeling, handling high-dimensional features can be memory-intensive, negatively impacting the applicationâ€™s overall performance. There are several methods to improve efficiency, including dimensionality reduction, feature selection, and a lesser-known technique: **feature hashing**.

Feature hashing transforms data into a sparse numeric matrix with a fixed size. By applying a hash function to each feature, we can map the represented feature into a sparse matrix, reducing memory consumption. In this project, we use **FeatureHasher** from Scikit-Learn to compute matrix columns corresponding to feature names.

## Implementation
This project demonstrates the use of FeatureHasher and explores six lesser-known Scikit-Learn functionalities that can significantly improve model performance and development time.

### 1. Feature Hashing with `FeatureHasher`
Feature hashing helps handle high-dimensional categorical data efficiently. We use `FeatureHasher` from `sklearn.feature_extraction` to transform categorical features into a sparse numerical representation.
